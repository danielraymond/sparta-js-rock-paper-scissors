# Rock Paper Scissors Homework

## Brief:

All tasks were completed.

## Difficulties:

I had difficulties at first using the functions as I forgot to use return ...
so that I could call the value produced from a function into another function. It took a long time to realise what I had forgotten to do.

## What I am proud of:

I am proud of how the code is split into neat functions that are concise.
